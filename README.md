You can check out a live demo of the app at https://zoromari.github.io/stop-timer-game/

## Rules

The game rules are incredibly simple: start one of the timers (set for 1, 5, 10, or 15 seconds), and then try to stop it as close to the end of the timer as possible.

The closer the timer is to the end, the better your score will be.

However, if the timer stops and you haven't managed to stop it in time, you lose the game..

Wishing you the best of luck and loads of fun!
